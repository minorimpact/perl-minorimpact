=head3 Database Configuration

Set up a database to use, if you don't already have one.  Included are basic instructions for installing a mysql database here, just for testing purposes.

  # yum install mariadb-server
  # systemctl mariadb start
  # mysql -e 'create database minorimpact;'
  # mysql -e "CREATE USER 'minorimpact'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'minorimpact';"
  # mysql -e "CREATE USER 'minorimpact'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'minorimpact';"
  # mysql -e "GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON minorimpact.* to 'minorimpact'@'localhost';"
  # mysql -e "GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON minorimpact.* to 'minorimpact'@'%';"

=head3 Configuration File

Create /etc/minorimpact.conf, if it doesn't already exist, and add the following database connection information:

  db:
    database = minorimpact
    db_host = localhost
    db_port = 3306
    db_user = minorimpact
    db_password = minorimpact

See L<MinorImpact::Manual::Configuration|MinorImpact::Manual::Configuration> for more configuration options.

=head3 Users

Change the admin user password by running the update_user.pl script installed from minorimpact-util.

  # /usr/loca/bin/update_user.pl -u admin -p admin
  Enter password for admin: admin
  Enter new password for admin:
                         Again:

Add a new user for yourself:

  # /usr/loca/bin/add_user.pl -u admin -a yes <user>
  Enter password for admin:
  Enter new password for <user>:
                          Again:

By default, MinorImpact will create a passwordless user in the database for any local
user running a MinorImpact script, based on the value on the $USER environment varable.
You can set a password for one of these users by running:

  # /usr/local/bin/update_user.pl -u admin -p <user>
